    "Presented here are a set of models for the Kaggle LANL Earthquake Challenge (Rouet-Leduc, et. al, 2019).  Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed in a separate Jupyter notebook, located with this file in the github repository (https://github.com/Vettejeep/MSDS696-Masters-Final-Project).  Please review the EDA for additional perspective on the problem.  The goal of the project is to predict the time that an earthquake will occur in a laboratory test.  The laboratory test applies shear forces to a sample of earth and rock containing a fault line.  Thus we note that these are laboratory earthquakes, not real earthquakes.  The simulated earthquakes tend to occur somewhat periodically because of the test setup, but this periodicity is not guaranteed to the researcher attempting to predict the time until an earthquake.

    "This problem has been approached here by regression modeling. The metric used by Kaggle in this competition is Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and thus a lower value is better with zero representing a perfect fit (Bilogur). This is a common regression metric. The acoustic data provided is used to create statistical features which are fed into supervised learning algorithms which then seek to predict the time until an earthquake from test signals. The training signal is provided by Kaggle in the form of a continuous acoustic signal that is over 629m samples long. This training data is accompanied by a ground truth time-to-failure (time until the next earthquake) for each acoustic sample. The user is left to decide how to extract information from the test signal in order to provide training data for their chosen machine learning algorithms. Given around 629m potential training samples, one challenge is how best to extract effective but still computationally tractable training sets from the given signal. The test signals are all 150k samples in length, thus it seems best to extract 150k sample sets from the training data."

    "While there are 2624 test signals provided by Kaggle, only 13% (341) are used for the public leader board (Rouet-Leduc, et. al, 2019).  The remainder are reserved for the final scoring that will be done after the competition concludes and after this course is finished.  While the Kaggle public leader board appears to be the best test set for model ranking currently available, there might be a lot of variance in the results when the remaining 87% of the test data is revealed.  Ensembles of models may therefore perform best where their individual weaknesses and variance tend to somewhat cancel out (Demir)."

    "Most of the published kernel scripts that this author has reviewed on Kaggle use a data row creation method that slices the 629 million row acoustic input data evenly into 4194 non-overlapping chunks of data that are equivalent in length to the 150k sample size of the Kaggle test samples. An example of this is the Preda (2019) kernel, but there are many other excellent scripts using this approach that the reader might review on Kaggle.  Slicing the data into 4194 chunks avoids overlap and possible information leakage between these slices as they then do not share any signal information.  These scripts appear to underfit the public leader board in the sense that cross validation (CV) scores tend to be higher (worse) than the public leader board score.  When I tried the Preda (2019) script, run from an IDE, this author obtained a public leader board score on Kaggle of 1.556 for the LightGBM model presented in that script.  However, the script CV scores appear to be just above 2.0.  "

    "The Preda (2019) script references a script by Andrew and one by a Kaggle user named Scirpus. I believe that the Andrew script is the one by Andrew Lukayenko (Lukayenko, 2019). Many of the feature creation ideas here appear to owe their origins to the Lukayenko (2019) script and it's cited predecessors. The script by Scirpus is interesting in being a very effective genetic programming model (Scirpus, 2019). Unfortunately the C++ code that the genetic algorithm has been written in does not appear to be publicly available. Only a result function containing the genetic algorithm's output mathematical functions, relationships and coefficients seem to be given by the author."

    "Partly because of the extensive exploration of slicing the data into 4194 non-overlapping slices in the Kaggle kernels by other challenge participants, and partly to set out on an individual exploration of modeling this data, a different approach is tried in the primary models presented here. 24,000 data rows were created in a stratified and then randomized manner. These are obtained from 6 simple slices of the original data, each slice is used to randomly create 4k data rows. This slicing accomplishes several objectives. First, it tends to help spread the random generation of data across the signal without risk of bunching too many slices into a compact region of the original signal. Second, it helped greatly with computational time and memory usage because multiprocessing can then be employed. In order to avoid having to load the whole 629m data set into memory 6 times, only the smaller slices with 1/6 of the data were loaded, one into each process. Multiprocessing allowed the main feature creation to run overnight, instead of possibly requiring days, which might have been required with a single process.  "

    "Experience below will show both the successes and challenges of this alternate method of feature creation. There are two possible approaches to model cross validation (CV) because of the stratification used by the multiprocessing. While indices for slicing data out of the model were chosen randomly, they were chosen from 6 slices of the original model data. Thus in addition to random selection for cross validation, working with 5 slices for training and 1 slice for validation as a 6 fold CV is also an option. These methods give very different and opposing CV results, but very similar Kaggle public leader board scores. This will be explored when model results are presented below."

    "Many of the processes and functions below are very long running, possibly taking overnight, or days, to complete. It is be best to transfer them to an IDE in order to run them. Also some of the code uses multiprocessing and this can be troublesome if run from Jupyter (Singhal, 2018). Code was tested using an IDE, not this notebook. I have used the Jupyter notebook here only for documentation and presentation purposes. The code is written using Python 3.6.6 and the library dependencies as noted below near the end of this document and in the imports. This code will work best if there is available at least a four core / 8 hyper-thread CPU, it was primarily tested on a Windows 10 operating system with an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU (8 cores, 16 logical threads) and 16GB of RAM. The training data set contains more than 629 million acoustic signal samples and is 10GB in size, so there is a lot of data to process. Then 24,000 data rows are created with 900 features extracted from the signal. Consequently, the individual functions often require many hours or days to run, even when using multiprocessing."

    "Another item to note is that the models mentioned herein are averaged ensembles of a cross validation (CV).  This allows usage of all of the training data for creating a Kaggle submission file while still reserving validation holdout sets.  This method also helps create more accurate models by averaging the results of different splits of the training data into training and validation sets.  The idea of creating the models in this way was taken from the Preda (2019) script as well as many others too numerous to cite that are present on the Kaggle website.  The true origin of this modeling approach is unknown to this author.  Accuracy, and Kaggle scoring position, appear to be gained by using this technique at a significant cost in additional model training time and complexity.  As an alternate view, one could argue that the CV is needed anyway, so why not take advantage of it as a direct model."

It ensures relatively even coverage of the width of the input signal and it allows for multiprocessing so that the script runs in a reasonable time.  Also, working on data chunks that represent only a portion of the very large input data set means that the whole data set is not loaded into memory multiple times (once for each process).

    "Feature creation by using wavelets to extract peak value and index information from the signal was also explored.  Due to extremely high computational time, this was only performed for the 24,000 sample models.  This algorithm uses a 'Mexican Hat' wavelet in the SciPy library and by interference with Mexican Hat wavelets finds the peak and peak index locations for the signal.  These features may have has a very small beneficial effect upon the model and a significant number of these features were deemed statistically significant by the Pearson's correlation performed in the feature reduction section of the modeling.  A problem is that this algorithm is very computationally expensive.  Running 6 processes on 24,000 samples required 3 days to complete.  The test set (2624 samples) was run as a single process over two days.  While the features remain in the model, it is arguable that their benefit was not worth 5 days of compute time.  The function below can be called for either the training or test sets."

    "Early on feature selection was performed via feature ranking output from a LightGBM model.  Removing some 150 features by this method provided a very tiny increase (0.001 MAE) in the Kaggle public leader board score.  However, it was difficult to know where to set a threshold for feature removal due to their being few obvious cut points in the feature scores.  More success was achieved by calculating the Pearson's correlation of the features with the target time-to-failure.  The Scipy \"pearsonr\" function provides a p-value that takes account of the sample size of the model.  Since statisticians generally consider p-values below 0.05 as representing significance, this value was chosen for the model's feature reduction algorithm. Scipy considers this p-value to be reasonably reliable for sample sizes above 500, which clearly is true for the models presented here (Scipy, 2019)."

Instead of the Kaggle public leader board score being better than the CV score, now the CV score is very low for random CV sampling. This is probably caused by information leakage between the samples because they are derived from signals that overlap in time.

Actually, in this model there is very slight leakage because this author was not fully cognizant of these possible effects and allowed a small 150k sample overlap between the 6 segments. Because this 150k sample overlap is so small compared to the 100 million plus samples in each 1/6th slice of the signal, leakage is effectively negligible. This changes the CV relationship back to that of the 4194 sample models reported, and again the CV score is much worse than the Kaggle leader board score.

Note, for example, that this author's XGBoost model with essentially non-overlapped cross validation had a CV score of 2.253 average. The Preda (2019) reference script had a CV of 2.082 average using LightGBM. Yet, the XGBoost model in question had a Kaggle public leader board MAE of 1.437, better than obtained for the Preda (2019) LightGBM model.

These models required 6 hours to train with LightGBM, and 30 minutes with XGBoost.  Semester time constraints made tuning efforts difficult as it would have required too many days to perform effective grid searches on the problem.  Realization that a sectionalized cross validation was also practical shortened LightGBM training times because the model eventually reached a point where it stopped improving on the validation data.  LightGBM training times then became almost identical to those of XGBoost.  This was actually not true for the randomly sampled CV model with Light GBM.  No final stopping point was ever found for this model.  While 60k estimators was eventually chosen from experience, the model would appear to continue to train up to 100k estimators or beyond.  "

For example, \"colsample_bytree\" in XGBoost was set to 0.667 where only 2/3 of the columns are selected for a split at each tree level was chosen because the documentation for XGBoost indicates that this helps with overfitting. Similarly, the number of leaves was decreased and the minimum data in a leaf increased for the same reason in LightGBM. It would have been helpful to try more hyperparameter tuning. Kaggle limits submission models to two per day and this proved to become a limitation for experimentation as the project due date approached. Hyperparamater tuning was particularly difficult because of the disconnect between leader board score and cross validation scores. Hyperparameter tuning was therefore less extensive than would be desirable. "

Both suffered from long training times in this scenario and CV scores that were not encouraging.  The author's inexperience with both of these algorithms appear to be the primary culprit.  Also tried were Random Forest (Brieman, 2001) decision tree-based algorithm and a model based on the Keras/Tenorflow Deep learning library (Chollet, et al., 2015) (Mart, et al., 2015).  While Keras and Tensorflow work very well on speech and vision applications, it does not to this author apppear fully competitive with the best tree-based gradient boosting models in a regression problem.

One should be cautious in doing so, it has proven all to easy to drastically overfit the training data and trials too numerous to document here have resulted in superb CV scores but lessened Kaggle leader board results. Even the current Kaggle public leader board result obtained is suspect because of the small amount of the test data that it contains, but a better test set does not appear to be available at present.  After the competition is over and the full test set is made available for scoring, this problem would be resolved for non-contest entries."

    "Building an effective model for a Kaggle challenge where the data is noisy and the leader board that utilizes only 13% of the potential test data is a significant challenge.  This is a problem where it is difficult to score well.  In terms of obtaining a good leader board score and to hopefully generalize well to the full leader board, 3 models were averaged here and submitted to Kaggle.  It is hoped that the diversity of model types and feature generation will help to stabilize the predictions submitted to Kaggle such that the model does generalize well when the full leader board is revealed at the end of the competition and after this university course has completed."
